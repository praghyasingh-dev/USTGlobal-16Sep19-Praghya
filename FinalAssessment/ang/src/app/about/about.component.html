        A Stock Management System is the combination of technology (hardware and software) and processes
        and procedures that oversee the monitoring and maintenance of stocked products, whether those
        products
        are company assets, raw materials and supplies, or finished products ready to be sent to vendors or
        end
        consumers.
        When most people think of inventory management, they think of retail applications. While retail
        operations rely heavily on inventory management, inventory management systems are widely used in a
        variety of industries, from manufacturing to utilities, healthcare, education, government, and more.
        Inventory management systems streamline and centralize the process for controlling the flow and
        maintenance of inventory to ensure that the right amount of inventory is available at the right time
        and of the right quality.
